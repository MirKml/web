Most of this classes are just simple rewrites from original dokuwiki classes.
Added better support for PHP5 - abstract classes, members visibility with 
the encapsulation, static methods, type hinting. Not all classes are rewritten
completely.

Classes are organized in the Zend_Loader compliant directory structure.

Some researched workflow, which I found in the dokuwiki parser documentation
and in the source code.

- call parser->parse($doc) this only calls lexer->parse($doc)
- lexer->parse calls reduce($doc) in loop
 - reduce return: prematched text, matched text label for regexp, that match the pattern,
 label is mode, for special modes, label is _mode e.g. _eol
 - call dispatchTokens() with above mentioned variables.
 - in dispatchTokens() add current mode onto stack and sent current matched text
 to the handler = call handler method for current mode with matched text, lexer state and
 position state in dispatchTokens()
 - dispatchTokens() calls invokeToken(), it calls handler for every call from the lexer, 
  adds one entry in his array with the appropriate instructions
